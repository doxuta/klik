## 10. Mascot: Teki – The Regal Meme Whisperer of TWAP

</p>

Why did we choose **Teki** as the mascot for **TWAP**?

Because only a cat with this much grace, sass, and perfectly crossed paws could represent the true spirit of meme culture on-chain.

- 😼 **Calm but Calculated**: Teki doesn't chase — Teki waits. Just like TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Pricing), Teki understands the art of timing.
- 🧠 **Sharp Gaze, Sharper Wit**: Behind those half-closed eyes is a tactical mind. Every meme minted on TWAP is judged silently by Teki’s unimpressed look of feline authority.
- 👑 **Meme Royalty Vibes**: Perched like a king on a throne (or a pillow-stool), Teki exudes the kind of chill power that every successful meme coin dreams of.
- 💡 **Symbol of Balance**: Meme creation needs edge and elegance. Teki’s zen aura captures both — a purring reminder that memes can move markets.

> 🌀 In a world of chaos, **Teki is the eye of the storm**.  
> The perfect mascot to represent the balance between **time-based strategy** and **meme-powered magic**.
